Rounding and truncation operator changes:
\ 0.01
round to the nearest hundredth

\ 50
round to the nearest 50

\_ 0.01
truncate to the greatest hundredth less than or equal to the number

\^ 0.01 round up to the nearest hundredth greater than or equal to the number

Other changes:
- Allow to set automatic rounding for all variables matching a
  particular regex (such as, say L[0-9]*)

Possible syntax:
x of pattern L[0-9]* = x \ 1

(This would round to the nearest whole number in the new syntax.)
