Provide a graphical product (or perhaps products: one done as a single
dialog box and another as a wizard) that allows filling in a multitude
of government forms (will require parsing comments; perhaps lex
comments and allow them only at the end of a declaration in the
parser).

Provide support for more forms than TurboTax, and perhaps allow users
to create their own forms.

Use flpsed (warning: GPLv3) or imagemagick (Apachev2) to auto-fill
forms for filing.

Allow tax planning by allowing any one or two boxes to be selected for
chart modeling against any single output (including total tax, average
tax rate, and marginal tax rate).

----------

Idea: Modify the forms to be used for different but related projects,
      like an individual and small-business tax return.  So form 1040
      becomes psimmons_f1040.  The form will have to be modified to
      prefix all foreign identifiers to have the same prefix.

Then, allow specific identifiers to have their definitions canceled
and defined in terms of an identifier from a related project.
Something like:

psimmons_f1040.L7 = simmonssystems_f1120.L13 * 0.9235
psimmons_f1040.L9b = simmonssystems_f1120.L30 - simmonssystems_f1120.L31
total_tax = psimmons_f1040.unlined_true_tax + simmonssystems_f1120.L31

(Include in help files common formulae for self-employed individuals
or couples or whatnot.)

PDFs
----

IRS PDFs are interactive forms.  A tool like PDFBox or PoDoFo should
be able to handle them.  flpsed or imagemagick are not required.

Business Plan
-------------

Code for Taxicality is open-source and held by foundation.
Forms for upcoming tax year are sold by subscription by a corporation.
Forms for current tax year are free.
