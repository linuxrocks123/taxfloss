Interpreter is given ordered list of all files with formulae to use in
calculating result, as well as one of the following:
1. A variable whose value to output
2. An undefined variable whose value should be varied between a given
   minimum and a given maximum using a given stepping, and another
   defined variable whose value, or, as specified, the first
   derivative of its value, should be output in a spreadsheet for each
   value the varied variable takes on.  Multiple output variables may
   be given in this case, but only one variable may be varied.
3. The same as above, except that two undefined variables may be
   varied and only one output variable may be placed into the
   spreadsheet.

First pass:
- Verify that no variable is used in an equation without first being
  declared (not necessarily defined).

Second pass:
- Create a forward symbol table by going through the list of
  declarations and placing all declared-but-not-defined symbols in the
  table, then filling in their values by executing all
  post-initialization declarations across all files ("<-").

Third pass:
- Execute all declarations in order that are not post-initializations.

(If the interpreter is being run in mode 2 or 3, special handling will
need to be done for the variable or variables that are being varied in
the second pass, and that special handling plus the third pass will
need to be executed many times.)
